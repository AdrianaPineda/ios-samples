## Skeleton view sample

This repository contains a sample app of a loading view (skeleton view). This kind of view is useful to:

-   Let the user know that the content is loading
-   Show the user a "skeleton" of the content that will be shown.

The sample app contains a `UIView` that will be animated when the `Run` button is clicked. It consists of a moving gradient from left to right with a delay between each loop.
