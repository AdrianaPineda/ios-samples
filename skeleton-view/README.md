## Skeleton view sample

This repository contains a sample app of a loading view (skeleton view). Apps, like facebook, use it when they are launched and are fetching the feed.

This kind of view is useful to:

-   Let the user know that the content is loading
-   Show the user a "skeleton" of the content that will be shown.

The sample app shows an animation of a `UIView`. The animation is a moving gradient (from left to right) with a delay between each loop.

## How to run

Open `SkeletonViewSample.xcodeproj` and run the app.

Click the `Run` button to start the animation.
